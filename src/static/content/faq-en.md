## How does the partitioner work?
- The partitioner uses the so-called Hungarian algorithm.
- The user prioritizes the provided groups based on their preferences.
- The user's preferences are translated into points so that the most points are given to the highest selection, and the lowest amount of points is given to the bottom selection or any unselected option.
- The Hungarian algorithm aims to achieve the highest possible sum of points given to each group.
- [The github page](https://github.com/piryopt/pienryhmien-optimointi/blob/main/documentation/hungarian.md) provides a more detailed explanation of the algorithm.
