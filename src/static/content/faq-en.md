## How does the partitioner work?
- The partitioner uses the so called hungarian algorithm
- User prioritizes the provided groups based on their preferences
- Preferences are translated into points so that the user gives most points to the groups theyâ€™ve selected as the first. Least amount of points is given to the last selection or any not-selected option
- The Hungarian algorithm prioritizes the groups selection so that the sum for all points given to a group is as high as possible
- [The github page](https://github.com/piryopt/pienryhmien-optimointi/blob/main/documentation/hungarian.md) provides a more detailed explanation of the algorithm
