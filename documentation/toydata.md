# Toy data
Simple data created for testing the early algorithms for grouping people by preference. Contains 15 imaginary people numbered with id, and their ordered list of group preference. Groups are named A, B, C, D, and E. Number of people per group is 3.

## Group preferences
The data is structured intentionally so that the groups have different profiles in preferences.

- A is very popular as both first and second preference.
- B is a popular second preference, but not first preference.
- C is a fairly popular first preference
- D is not a popular choice
- E has exactly three people choosing it as first preference
