### Steps of the Hungarian algorithm
Steps 3-6 as presented on [hungarianalgorithm.com](https://www.hungarianalgorithm.com/hungarianalgorithm.php) as steps 1-4

**Step 1: Formulate an nxn matrix where each column represents a spot open for a student, and the cells represent the profit of placing a student to a group**
- If a group has multiple spots represent each of these with a column
- If there are more spots open than there are students, add empty rows to match the number of rows to the number of columns
- The cell values are calculated as profits based on how high the student has 

**Step 2: Transform profit matrix to cost matrix**

**Step 3: Subtract row minima**

**Step 4: Subtract column minima**

**Step 5: Cover all zeros with a minimum number of lines**

**Step 6: Create additional zeros if needed**
