# Jakaja 2.0

Jakaja is a group assignment optimization application originally developed in the Software Engineering Lab course at the University of Helsinki.  
The system helps assign students into groups based on their preferences, using the **Hungarian Algorithm**. Teachers can create surveys, students submit their preferences, and after closing the survey, the system divides students into groups. Results can be exported to Excel.

The goal of **Jakaja 2.0** is to extend and refine the original system to better handle real-world requirements and improve maintainability.

## Differences from Jakaja 1.0

### Improvements

    - **Group size constraints:**
        - Teachers can define **minimum and maximum group sizes**
        - Group size rules are **stronger than student preferences** (unpopular groups must still reach a minimum size)
        -

    - **Multi-dimensional preferences:**
        - Instead of only a single theme, students can express preferences along **two axes** (*topic* and *schedule*, or *placement* and *partner experience*)
        - The assignment algorithm considers both dimensions in optimization

    - **Priority groups:**
        - Teachers can assign higher or lower **priority weights** to certain groups
        - Algorithm adapts to balance preferences with these weights
